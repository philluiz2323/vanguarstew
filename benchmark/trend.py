"""Track a benchmark score across a series of saved replay artifacts.

``compare_eval`` diffs *two* artifacts and ``--fail-under`` gates a *single* run against a fixed
floor. This adds the N-way view: given several artifacts in chronological order, extract each
one's headline composite score, show the point-to-point deltas and the overall change, and flag
**regressions** - a drop from one point to the next larger than a threshold - so a score
sliding over successive runs is caught (CI trend-gating), not only a single run dipping below a
static floor.

Pure analysis: it performs no I/O, never mutates its inputs, and tolerates an artifact with a
missing or non-numeric score (that point contributes ``None`` and is skipped in delta/regression
math) so a partial series still produces a trend instead of raising.
