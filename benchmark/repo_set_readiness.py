"""Gate whether a repo-set config is ready for a leakage-safe acceptance run.

``validate_repo_set`` checks that a config is *well-formed*, but nothing checks the orthogonal
question: is a well-formed set actually **adequate** to run M3/M4 generalization acceptance on?
Starting a long ``run_eval --generalization`` replay only to discover the set has one tuned repo,
or a leftover starter placeholder, wastes the run.

``check_readiness(config)`` reuses the canonical :func:`~benchmark.repo_set.validate_repo_set`
(an invalid config fails a single ``valid_config`` check), then reports named readiness checks:

1. ``min_tuned`` — at least ``min_tuned`` tuned (non-held-out) repos;
2. ``min_held_out`` — at least ``min_held_out`` held-out repos;
3. ``pre_llm_windows`` — every repo bounds its freeze points before ``PRE_LLM_CUTOFF``;
4. ``no_placeholder_sources`` — no starter ``OWNER/...`` placeholder URLs remain.

``both_tiers`` (both ``recent`` and ``obscure`` tiers represented) was check 3 until 2026-07-16.
It encoded the recent+obscure hedge: "recent" freeze windows sit past a model's training cutoff so
the outcome cannot have been memorized. Two findings retired it. First, the hedge's premise did not
hold — a leakage probe asked the scoring model to recall the commits following a known commit and it
declined for every repo tested, *including* ``pallets/flask`` and ``psf/requests``; commit-sequence
recall is not a realistic vector for famous or obscure repos alike, so "recent" was guarding a door
that was not open (and the model knows the *content* of obscure repos regardless, so obscurity never
bought memorization protection either). Second, "recent" is now actively harmful: a post-cutoff
window is by definition the LLM-assisted era, so its ground truth is partly LLM-written — and
"predict what the maintainer did next" is circular when an LLM did it. ``pre_llm_windows`` replaces
it with the invariant the set is now built on, so a recent-window repo cannot quietly reappear.

The companion ``scripts/repo_set_readiness.py`` exits non-zero when the set is not ready.

Pure evaluation: no I/O, never mutates the config; a malformed/non-dict config fails
``valid_config`` with an explicit check rather than raising.
