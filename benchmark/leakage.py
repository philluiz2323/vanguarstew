"""Leakage defenses applied to the frozen-at-T context.

Even data that is legitimately knowable at T can *cross-reference* the future — a commit
subject like "part of #512", a `Fixes #900` backlink, a link to a later PR, or a raw commit
SHA. Those leak where the repo went next. We neutralize such references in the free-text
fields of the context while keeping the substantive content (the roadmap, titles, prose)
the agent legitimately needs to infer trajectory.

This is deterministic and offline; it is one layer of the leakage strategy (see
docs/architecture.md), alongside the no-internet sandbox and recent/obscure repo selection.

The GitHub-link matcher is boundary-aware: it stops at the structural characters
that surround a URL in prose or markdown (parens, square/angle brackets, quotes)
and peels trailing sentence punctuation (.,;!) back into the surrounding text, so
legitimate context survives while the forward reference itself is masked. Bare
owner/repo URLs (which carry no specific forward reference) are left untouched.
