"""Gate whether a --generalization run actually generalizes to its held-out repos.

M3/M4 ask the maintainer agent to hold up on *diverse, unseen* repos, not just the ones it was
tuned on. ``run_multi_replay --generalization`` already reports a ``tuned`` partition, a
``held_out`` partition, and the ``generalization_gap`` between them - but nothing turns that into
a pass/fail decision. A run that tuned to 0.70 and then collapsed to 0.40 on held-out repos has a
0.30 gap that should *block* promotion; today it flows through unflagged.

``check_generalization(result, max_gap=…, min_held_out_repos=…)`` evaluates named criteria:

1. ``has_partitions`` - both ``tuned`` and ``held_out`` partitions carry a composite score;
2. ``enough_held_out_repos`` - the held-out partition scored at least ``min_held_out_repos``
   distinct repos (a one-repo held-out set doesn't demonstrate generalization);
3. ``gap_within_tolerance`` - the tuned-minus-held-out drop is at most ``max_gap`` (the agent
   didn't overfit the tuned set). A held-out score that *exceeds* tuned is a non-positive gap and
   always within tolerance.

The gap is recomputed from the two composites (rounded to their precision) rather than trusting a
possibly-stale ``generalization_gap`` field. The companion ``scripts/generalization_gate.py``
exits non-zero when the run didn't generalize.

Pure evaluation: no I/O, never mutates the result, and a malformed/non-dict result simply fails
the relevant checks rather than raising.
