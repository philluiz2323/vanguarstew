"""Gate whether a benchmark task set's replay windows are independent (non-overlapping).

``taskgen.generate_tasks`` picks freeze points from a repo's history; the replay scores the agent
at each freeze index ``f`` against the next ``horizon`` commits (its ``revealed`` window,
``commits[f+1 .. f+horizon]``). For the tasks to be *independent* samples, no task's freeze commit
may fall inside an earlier task's revealed window — i.e. any two freeze indices must be more than
``horizon`` apart. When they aren't, one task's judged "future" is another task's frozen
"present": the scenarios overlap, biasing the win/loss record and undermining the M1 "re-runs are
stable" guarantee.

``generate_tasks`` does not guarantee this: its ``rotation_seed`` path draws freeze points with
``random.sample`` (which can pick adjacent indices), and a small date-bounded pool can force a
step of 1. ``task_integrity`` checks the set is well-formed and has *distinct* freeze points, but
distinctness alone doesn't make two freeze points independent — they can differ by 1 and still
overlap. Nothing gates window overlap.

``check_task_independence(tasks, horizon=…)`` verifies, each check failing closed:

1. ``is_task_list`` — ``tasks`` is a non-empty list whose every entry is an object;
2. ``freeze_indices_valid`` — every task carries a non-negative integer ``freeze_index``;
3. ``windows_independent`` — every pair of freeze indices differs by more than ``horizon`` (so the
   ``[f, f+horizon]`` spans are disjoint). Trivially true for a single task.

The companion ``scripts/task_independence.py`` exits non-zero when the windows overlap.

Pure evaluation: no I/O, never mutates its input, and a malformed/non-list task set simply fails
the relevant checks rather than raising.
