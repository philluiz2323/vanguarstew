"""Report the skip share of a replay artifact — the fraction of repos that did not score.

A replay set has ``repos`` repositories; only ``scored_repos`` of them produce composite scores, and
the rest are *skipped* (``skipped = repos - scored_repos``). ``skip_budget`` *gates* whether too many
were skipped; this utility only *reports* the skip share, with per-partition detail for a
``--generalization`` artifact, so a dashboard can surface coverage without deciding a pass/fail.

Pure analysis: no I/O, never mutates its input. Malformed accounting (non-integer, negative, or
``scored > repos`` counts, a zero-repo slice, or a missing partition) yields ``None`` fields rather
than raising, and the headline degrades to ``n/a`` on a non-finite share.
