"""Summarize decisive versus tie task shares from a replay artifact tally.

``win_rate`` reports challenger/baseline/tie rates separately; this utility focuses on how
often judging produced a decisive winner versus a tie — useful for spotting memorized-tie
artifacts in CI dashboards. A ``--generalization`` artifact nests its tallies under ``tuned`` /
``held_out``, so the overall rate is summed from those partitions (mirroring ``win_rate``).

Pure analysis: no I/O, never mutates its input, and a missing or malformed tally yields
``None`` rates rather than raising.
