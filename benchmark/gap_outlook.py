"""Report generalization gap outlook from a tuned/held-out replay artifact.

``acceptance`` gates whether the gap is within a bound; this utility only reports the gap,
partition headline scores, and whether held-out performance held up versus tuned. Since
``generalization_gap = tuned - held_out`` (positive means held-out did *worse*, mirroring
``runner``/``acceptance``/``gap_integrity``), the verdict is ``favorable`` when
``generalization_gap <= 0`` and ``unfavorable`` otherwise.

The gap is recomputed from the two partition composites (rounded to three decimals) rather than
trusting a possibly-stale top-level ``generalization_gap`` field — mirroring
``check_generalization`` — so a hand-edited or drifted gap cannot flip the outlook verdict.

Pure analysis: no I/O, never mutates its input, and missing telemetry yields ``None`` fields.
