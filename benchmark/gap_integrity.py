"""Gate whether a ``--generalization`` artifact's gap matches its partition scores.

``run_generalization_report`` sets ``generalization_gap`` to
``round(tuned.composite_mean - held_out.composite_mean, 3)`` when both partitions scored at
least one repo, and ``None`` otherwise. ``check_acceptance`` gates whether the gap is
*reasonable*; nothing verifies it was *computed correctly* from the partition composites.

``check_gap_integrity(report)`` verifies:

1. ``is_generalization`` — the artifact carries ``tuned``, ``held_out``, and
   ``generalization_gap`` keys;
2. ``gap_absent_when_unscored`` — when either partition has ``scored_repos == 0``, the gap is
   ``None``;
3. ``gap_present_when_both_scored`` — when both partitions scored, the gap is numeric;
4. ``tuned_composite_reported`` / ``held_out_composite_reported`` — both partition composites are
   numeric when a gap is expected;
5. ``gap_matches_partitions`` — ``round(reported_gap, 3)`` equals
   ``round(tuned.composite_mean - held_out.composite_mean, 3)`` (same rule as
   :func:`~benchmark.runner.run_generalization_report`).

**Rounding semantics:** the expected gap is computed once with ``round(delta, 3)``. The reported
gap is normalized with ``round(reported, 3)`` before comparison. ``tolerance`` (default ``0.0``)
allows a non-zero bound only for artifacts that carry extra float noise beyond three decimal
places; it is *not* applied to unrounded intermediate means.

The companion ``scripts/gap_integrity.py`` exits non-zero when the gap is inconsistent.

Pure evaluation: no I/O, never mutates the report; malformed/non-dict input fails with explicit
checks rather than raising.
