"""CLI: score a PR's ``agent/`` against a baseline on the same benchmark run, and report
which measured-improvement performance band (if any) the PR earns — evidence, not a read
of the diff.

  python -m scripts.score_pr_delta baseline_result.json candidate_result.json

Both inputs are ``run_eval --out`` artifacts (produced by running the SAME repo-set/task
count against the baseline agent and the PR's agent respectively). This tool never runs
the benchmark itself — it only judges two already-produced results — so it has no model,
network, or repo-set opinions of its own.

Policy (the anti-Goodhart floor from docs/spec-driven-development.md / REVIEW.md):
  - A regression on either the judge or the objective component (past the noise floor) is
    a hard merge block for ``agent/`` PRs — trading one axis off for the other (sounding
    better to the judge while the objective anchor quietly drops) counts as a regression,
    not an improvement. This is the Pareto floor. ``band == "blocked"`` / ``blocks_merge``
    reflect this directly.
  - Otherwise, the composite_mean delta is bucketed into a performance band —
    ``perf:xs`` .. ``perf:xl`` — by magnitude (see BAND_THRESHOLDS). A delta at or below
    the noise floor earns ``band == "none"``: still mergeable, just no value multiplier
    (a clean refactor or typo fix with no measurable effect on agent performance).
  - Band thresholds are DELIBERATELY ROUGH right now — this project has one real
    benchmark-delta data point so far. They're a single ordered table
    (BAND_THRESHOLDS) so they can be recalibrated in one place once enough real
    ``score_pr_delta`` runs exist to know what a genuinely large win looks like on this
    benchmark. Log every real result; don't guess twice.
  - This script is a REPORTER, not a gate: it always exits 0. A CI workflow or the
    maintainer bot decides what to do with the recommendation (post a comment, apply a
    label, merge/close) — kept separate so the policy stays testable in isolation from
    that mechanics.
