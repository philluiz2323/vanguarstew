"""Extract the public-safe fields from a real score_pr_delta / combine_dual_target() result,
for the public leaderboard feed the maintainer bot publishes to the project's GitHub Pages site
(gittensor-vanguard.github.io/vanguarstew) after every real (non-offline) agent/ PR score.

This is the one place that decides what's safe to publish. The rule is the same one the whole
hidden-repo-set mechanism already runs on: the SCORING MECHANISM is public (composite deltas,
bands, per-repo breakdowns), but a PRIVATE repo target's identity never is.

  - The public target's ``per_repo`` breakdown is safe to publish verbatim: those are
    ``benchmark/repo_sets/curated.json``'s repos, already public knowledge.
  - The private target contributes ONLY its composite delta -- never its diff, never its
    per-repo breakdown (which would leak which repos are in the hidden set), never anything
    else from its ``diff`` payload.

Two DIFFERENT deltas can appear on one entry:
  - The per-PR band's delta (``public``/``private`` top-level keys) is against the base
    branch's state at the moment this PR was scored -- a SHIFTING baseline that moves every
    time a PR merges. This is what decides the perf:* label; it answers "was this PR a real
    improvement over what came immediately before it."
  - ``since_anchor`` (optional) is against a FIXED, named release (e.g. v0.5.0) that never
    moves until the anchor itself is rolled forward. This answers "how much better is the
    agent now than at our last tagged release" -- the cumulative-progress line, not a
    per-PR eligibility check. Carries both ``composite_delta`` AND the absolute
    ``composite_score``/``anchor_score`` scalars, so the leaderboard page can draw a
    growing bar per PR, not just a signed delta. See _since_anchor_fields().

Pure data transformation: no I/O, no network, no repo-set opinions of its own.
